# Technical stack overview

Flus is using [PHP](https://www.php.net/) 8.2+. The version isn’t strongly
fixed and can change. While I’ll do my best to keep things simple, remember
that easy installation is not my main priority. The minimal PHP version is
usually following the version of the production server which run on Debian.
Some PHP dependencies in development are managed with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

It’s using a personal PHP framework: [Minz](https://github.com/flusio/Minz).
The framework is directly integrated in the source code (as a submodule) since
it’s intended to evolve with the application.

The only supported database is [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) 13+
because I use specific features from it. I will not add support for other
databases.

The asynchronous jobs, such as emails sending, are handled by a PHP script. The
worker should be configured as a OS service (e.g. systemd service), or can be
handled via a CRON task (but with less efficiency).

The assets (CSS and JS) are bundled with [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/). The
JavaScript relies on both [Stimulus](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/) (“a modest
JavaScript framework”) and [Turbo](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/) (used to speed
up navigation on the application). The dependencies are managed with
[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), the default Node package manager. NPM is not
needed in production because I bundle assets and add them in the repository at
each new release.

The test suite is runned over [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).
It’s using [PHPUnit 9](https://phpunit.de/) as a testing framework and
[PHP\_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) as a linter
for the PHP files. JS files are linted with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/semi)
and CSS files with [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/).

The development environment is powered by Docker and Docker Compose setting up
5 containers: a PHP server, a Nginx server, a job worker, a PostgreSQL database and
a Node container running Parcel in watch mode. See the [`docker/` folder](/docker/)
for more information.

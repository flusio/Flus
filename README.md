    <strong>Collect, organise, comment on and share links from around the Web.</strong>

Flus brings together news feed aggregation and social bookmarking in a modern
way. It is designed as a simple, yet complete tool for organising the links you
gather around the Web. It comes with four main features:

- the **feeds aggregation** (<abbr>RSS</abbr> and Atom) to follow any website,
  podcast or video channel in one place;
- the **bookmarks and collections** to save your favourites articles for later
  and to organise them;
- the **news** to keep control over your newsfeed;
- the **profile** to share links with others.

You can try Flus for free at [demo.flus.fr](https://demo.flus.fr/).

It’s [free/libre software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software)
(politically speaking) while being supported by a micro-enterprise to ensure
its viability. The main service is available to French people at [flus.fr](https://flus.fr).
You can help to fund the development by taking a subscription to the service.

Flus is licensed under [AGPL 3](/LICENSE.txt).

## How to contribute?

I sincerely appreciate if you want to contribute. Here’s a few things you can
do:

- taking a subscription at [flus.fr](https://flus.fr) (French);
- reporting bugs or make feature requests [in issues](https://github.com/flusio/Flus/issues);
- writing blog posts to speak about the project.

I don’t accept Pull Requests on this project. A code contribution requires a
lot of time to review, to comment and to maintain. Even the smallest one can
require hours of my time. Also, code isn’t where I need help.

If you have any question, feel free to [send me a message](https://flus.fr/contact).

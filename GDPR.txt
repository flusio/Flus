# It is intended to hosting providers who want to provide a service based on
# Flus, to help them to comply to GDPR requirements. Note that the services
# powered by Flus may collect more data, HTTP logs in particular. As a

# data are used and protected.

data: email
required: yes
visibility: private
description:
    The email address is used to connect users to the service. It is required
    and must be verified to allow the hosting provider to communicate with its
    users in case of compromise of personal data. It also can be used to notice
    users of changes in the terms of service. Users can receive instructions to
    reset their password at this address.
mitigation:
    Users can use a relay service to anonymize their address to the hosting
    provider. Users with non-validated email addresses are deleted from the
    database 6 months after their inscription.

data: password
required: yes
visibility: private
description:
    The password is used to connect users to the service.
mitigation:
    Only hashes of the passwords are stored in database. It uses bcrypt with
    default options to create the hashes (see PHP password_hash function).

data: username
required: yes
visibility: public
description:
    The username is used to identify users publicly over the service.
mitigation:
    Users can use a pseudonyme if they don’t want to use their real name.

data: ip
required: yes
visibility: private
description:
    The IP is used to allow the users and the administrators to identify their
    sessions, and eventually to detect a login by an attacker.
mitigation:
    The last bit of the IP is anonymized.

data: user agent
required: yes
visibility: private
description:
    The User Agent is used to allow the users and the administrators to
    identify their sessions, and eventually to detect a login by an attacker.
mitigation:
    Only the browser and the platform are stored (e.g. 'Firefox on Linux').

data: locale
required: yes
visibility: public
description:
    The locale is used to translate the interface to the user's language.
mitigation:
    The locale is not directly revealed publicly, but it can be guessed by
    other users via the Atom feeds (which are automatically set to their
    owners' language).

data: avatar
required: no
visibility: public
description:
    Avatars are images used to distinguish users visually and express their
    identity.
